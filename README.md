# ML_Classification_Project_IRIS



### Project: Comprehensive Classification Analysis

#### **1. Problem Statement:**
- Work on a classification problem of Iris dataset. 

#### **2. Objectives:**
- Implement and understand Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.
- Evaluate these models using cross-validation and performance metrics.

#### **3. Key Steps:**

**a. Data Preparation:**
- Load and explore the dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handle missing values, categorical data encoding, feature scaling).

**b. Model Implementation:**
- Implement Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.

**c. Model Evaluation:**
- Use k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.
- Collect metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

**d. Model Comparison:**
- Compare model performance based on metrics.
- Discuss each model's strengths and weaknesses.

#### **4. Deliverables:**

**a. Code:**
- Jupyter Notebook with all code and annotations.

**b. Report:**
- Document methodology, results, and insights.
- Include ROC curves and Confusion Matrices for each model.
- Provide a comprehensive analysis of findings.

#### **5. Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Correct Implementation**: Each model should be implemented and executed properly.
- **Code Quality**: Organized and well-commented code.
- **Model Evaluation**: Effective use of cross-validation and thorough evaluation.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Depth in comparing and interpreting model performances.

#### **6. Tips for Success:**
- Spend time understanding the dataset.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters.
